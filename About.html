		<h1 id="about">About Us</h1>
		<h1 id="text1">SEE I Can Read™ children's books are designed to teach 3 to 6 year olds to read by themselves. <br>
		The concept was conceived as Cris Lindsey, President of Millennium 2000 Publishing Company, <br>
		was working with his daughter Sarah. He wanted her to be able to read her own mail when he wrote to her. <br>
		He created the books to give his daughter as well as other children a sense of independence. <br>
		The books were created using picture illustrations to form the sentences, with the actual words written <br>
		under the pictures so that the child can recognize the pictures and associate it with the word beneath it. </h1>
		<h1 id="text2">The purpose of this book is to give young children a sense of independence in reading. <br>
		“See I can read©” is designed to help young children get a head start in reading concept — The structure. <br>
		It also assists children acquring basic sight words as children associate the illustrations with the matching sentences. <br>
		This book is intendeded to be a fun learning tool for children 3 - 6 years of age. </h1>
